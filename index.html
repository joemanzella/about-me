    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a recovering urban planner/policy wonk who works in public relations, builds websites, does graphic design and has been known to make things move, blink and fly using an Arduino or a BeagleBone. I like learning new things and solving big problems
      with the combined power of research, statistics and coffee.</p>

  <section class="location-section">
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I was born in Detroit, raised in the suburbs, and spent my professional career in and around Michigan's capital, Lansing.</p>
    <p>I try to spend as much time as I can in Houghton Lake, MI.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>So... I like to build websites, do graphic design, and make things blink or fly using an Arduino or Beaglebone.</p>
    <p>I'm also a big hockey fan - pretty sure I can still name most of the Red Wings' 1997 Stanley Cup-winning team.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>Is there a place where people can work from the beach? Is that a thing? Barring that, my dream job would be to create robots for BattleBots. Barring that, I'd settle for astronaut. If none of those work out, I suppose doing more web development work wouldn't be so bad.</p>
